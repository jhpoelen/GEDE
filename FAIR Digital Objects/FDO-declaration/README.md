The Paris meeting about the FDO approach came up with a declaration. We would motivate everyone interested in this approach to sign the declaration. If you would like to sign either as individual or on behalf of a organisation, please send an email with a clear statement to Zsuzsanna (zsuzsanna.szeredi@gmail.com). If you sign on behalf of an organisation or initiative, please, provide a logo in proper resolution. We will create a web-site where the declaration including all signers will appear.
